# rsearch Implementation Orchestration Plan

**Date:** 2024-11-24
**Status:** Active
**Estimated Timeline:** 4-5 weeks (vs 11 weeks sequential)

## Overview
Comprehensive orchestration plan for rsearch using git worktrees for parallel development, specialized subagents for independent tasks, and superpowers skills for quality gates.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Milestone 1 - Sequential)

**Git Worktree Strategy:**
```
rsearch/                    # main branch - integration point
├── worktree-foundation/    # Milestone 1
├── worktree-parser/        # Milestone 2 (starts after foundation)
├── worktree-schema/        # Milestone 3 (parallel with parser)
└── worktree-translator/    # Milestone 4 (after schema)
```

**Tasks (Sequential - must complete first):**
1. Project setup with Go modules
2. Configuration system (viper)
3. HTTP server skeleton (chi/gin)
4. Health/metrics endpoints
5. Logging infrastructure

**Execution:**
- Use `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` to create foundation worktree
- Single golang-pro agent for rapid setup
- No parallelization needed (foundational dependencies)

---

## Phase 2: Core Components (Milestones 2-4 - Parallel)

### Strategy: 3 Parallel Git Worktrees

**Worktree 1: Parser & AST (Milestone 2)**
- Agent: `systems-programming:golang-pro`
- Skill: `superpowers:test-driven-development`
- Files: `internal/parser/*`
- Independent: No external dependencies after foundation

**Worktree 2: Schema System (Milestone 3)**
- Agent: `systems-programming:golang-pro`
- Skill: `superpowers:test-driven-development`
- Files: `internal/schema/*`, `internal/api/handlers.go` (schema endpoints)
- Independent: Can develop concurrently with parser

**Worktree 3: Translator Interface (Milestone 4 prep)**
- Agent: `systems-programming:golang-pro`
- Files: `internal/translator/translator.go` (interface only)
- Wait for: Parser AST types, Schema types
- Then parallel: PostgreSQL implementation

### Parallel Execution Plan:

```bash
# Dispatch 3 agents in parallel
Task 1 (Parser): Implement lexer, tokens, AST nodes, recursive descent parser
Task 2 (Schema): Registry with RWMutex, field resolution, naming conventions
Task 3 (Translator Interface): Define Translator interface and output types
```

**Quality Gates:**
- Each agent runs with TDD (red-green-refactor)
- `superpowers:requesting-code-review` after each milestone
- Integration testing when merging worktrees

---

## Phase 3: Query Syntax Implementation (Milestone 5 - Highly Parallel)

### Strategy: Feature-Based Git Worktrees

The query syntax milestone has 8 independent feature sets:

**Parallel Worktrees (8 concurrent agents):**

1. **worktree-operators**: AND, OR, NOT, +, - operators
2. **worktree-ranges**: Inclusive, exclusive, mixed ranges
3. **worktree-wildcards**: Wildcard and regex support
4. **worktree-fuzzy**: Fuzzy search (with pg_trgm detection)
5. **worktree-proximity**: Proximity search (with FTS detection)
6. **worktree-boost**: Boost queries
7. **worktree-field-groups**: Field grouping syntax
8. **worktree-exists**: _exists_ queries

**Execution with `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`:**
```
8 independent golang-pro agents
Each with TDD skill active
Each produces: parser code + translator code + tests
Merge order: operators → ranges → wildcards → (rest in parallel)
```

**Dependencies Graph:**
```
operators (base) → all others can build on top
ranges, wildcards, fuzzy, proximity, boost, field-groups, exists → all parallel
```

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Testing (Milestone 6 - Parallel)

### Strategy: 3 Parallel Streams

**Worktree 1: Test Infrastructure**
- Agent: `backend-development:backend-architect`
- Tasks: Test case JSON format, integration test framework
- Files: `tests/integration_test.go`, `examples/test_cases.json`

**Worktree 2: Documentation Generator**
- Agent: `systems-programming:golang-pro`
- Tasks: Auto-doc generator from tests
- Files: `cmd/gendocs/main.go`

**Worktree 3: Dev Environment**
- Agent: `backend-development:backend-architect`
- Tasks: Docker compose, sample data, init scripts
- Files: `docker-compose.dev.yaml`, `testdata/*`

**Integration Examples (Sequential after worktree 3):**
- Dispatch 4 agents for language examples: JS, Python, PHP, Go

---

## Phase 5: Production Hardening (Milestone 7 - Parallel)

### Strategy: Security & Performance Worktrees

**Parallel Worktrees (6 concurrent):**

1. **worktree-error-handling**: Comprehensive error types and responses
2. **worktree-rate-limiting**: Per-IP rate limiter
3. **worktree-caching**: Query parsing cache with LRU
4. **worktree-security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention
5. **worktree-performance**: Benchmarking and optimization
6. **worktree-metrics**: Prometheus metrics implementation

**Skills Applied:**
- `superpowers:defense-in-depth` for security worktree
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` for performance
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before merge

---

## Phase 6: Additional Databases (Milestone 8 - Parallel)

### Strategy: Database-Specific Worktrees

**3 Parallel Worktrees:**

1. **worktree-mysql**: MySQL translator
2. **worktree-sqlite**: SQLite translator
3. **worktree-mongodb**: MongoDB translator

Each agent:
- Implements `Translator` interface
- TDD with comprehensive test suite
- Integration tests with real database

**Execution:**
```
3 golang-pro agents in parallel
Each implements same interface → merge easily
No conflicts (separate files)
```

---

## Phase 7: Release Preparation (Milestone 9 - Parallel)

### Strategy: Deployment Worktrees

**Parallel Worktrees (4 concurrent):**

1. **worktree-docker**: Dockerfile, Alpine image
2. **worktree-k8s**: Kubernetes manifests, helm charts
3. **worktree-docs**: Complete documentation, examples
4. **worktree-release**: CI/CD, release automation

---

## Orchestration Execution Commands

### Step 1: Foundation (Sequential)
```bash
# Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees skill
# Create foundation worktree
# Deploy golang-pro agent with TDD skill
```

### Step 2: Core Components (3 Parallel)
```bash
# Dispatch 3 parallel agents using superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents
# Agent 1: Parser implementation
# Agent 2: Schema system
# Agent 3: Translator interface
# Each in separate git worktree
```

### Step 3: Query Syntax (8 Parallel)
```bash
# Dispatch 8 parallel agents
# Each handles one query feature
# All use TDD skill
# Merge with superpowers:requesting-code-review between batches
```

### Step 4: Integration & Review
```bash
# Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch for each worktree
# Sequential merge with code review
# Integration tests run after each merge
```

## Estimated Timeline with Parallel Execution

**Original: 11 weeks sequential**
**Optimized: 4-5 weeks with parallelization**

- Week 1: Foundation (sequential, must complete)
- Week 2: Core components (3 parallel streams)
- Week 3: Query syntax (8 parallel streams) + Documentation (3 parallel)
- Week 4: Production hardening (6 parallel) + Additional DBs (3 parallel)
- Week 5: Release prep (4 parallel) + final integration

---

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Merge Conflicts**: Git worktrees + clear file ownership prevents conflicts
2. **Integration Issues**: Code review skill after each worktree completion
3. **Test Failures**: TDD skill ensures tests written first
4. **Quality Degradation**: Verification skill before claiming completion
